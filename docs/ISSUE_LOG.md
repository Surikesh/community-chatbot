### Issue #001: Text Cutoff in ActivityCard Component
**Date Fixed**: 2025-06-02  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: `frontend/src/components/activities/ActivityCard.tsx`

#### **Problem Description**
Activity card titles were being cut off in an awkward way, particularly noticeable in the screenshot showing "City Cycling Route" title being truncated.

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. Container width constraints (`max-w-[85%]`)
2. Large margins (`ml-12/mr-12`) reducing content area
3. No proper word breaking for long text
4. Fixed font sizes not scaling on smaller screens

#### **Solution Implemented**
1. **Text Handling**: Responsive font sizes, `break-words`, `min-w-0` for overflow
2. **Layout**: Increased max-width to 90%, reduced margins to `ml-8/mr-8`
3. **CSS**: Added line-clamp utilities, responsive padding
4. **Testing**: Added long title test cases

#### **Files Modified**
- `ActivityCard.tsx`, `MessageBubble.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `globals.css`

#### **Result**
- Text wraps properly without cutoffs
- Better responsive design across screen sizes
- Improved space utilization in chat interface
- All 21 tests still pass

#### **Prevention**
- Enhanced testing for long text scenarios
- Documented responsive design patterns
- Added text handling best practices
